# Tuneshine power-saver

A Pico W that polls a server, and turns the relay on/off depending on the value it receives.

## Setup

Install the [pico-sleep](https://github.com/ghubcoder/micropython-pico-deepsleep?tab=readme-ov-file) uf2 (use the Pico W one).

Using Thonny, upload the py files. Add SSID and password to wifi.conf

## Notes

Power bank will need to be in low power mode - usually by holding the power button down. On mine, the % display will stay on, and single digit will "circle" every few seconds.
